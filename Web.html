                     they change in chemical reactions. As such, it can be considered a branch of physical science, alongside astronomy,
                     physics and earth sciences including geology. Being able to describe the ingredients in a cake and how they change 
                     when the cake is baked is called chemistry. Matter is anything that has mass and takes up space—that is, anything 
                     that is physically real.</p>

                    <p>English is a West Germanic language of the Indo-European language family, with its earliest forms spoken by the

                      migrated to the island of Great Britain. Modern English is widely considered to be the lingua franca of the world 
                      and is the standard language in a wide variety of fields, including computer coding, international business, and 
                      higher education.</p>

                       and some of the earliest archeological evidence for scientific reasoning is tens of thousands of years old.</p>

                    <p>Calculus, originally called infinitesimal calculus or "the calculus of infinitesimals", is the mathematical study of continuous
                       change, in the same way that geometry is the study of shape, and algebra is the study of generalizations of arithmetic operations.
                       In simplest terms, calculus is a branch of mathematics that deals with rates of change. For example: maybe you want to calculate the 
                       change in velocity of a car rolling to a stop at a red light. Calculus can help you figure out that change. That's right: calculus puts
                       movement into math!</p>

                       concerned with specific functions of angles and their application to calculations. There are six functions of an angle commonly used in 
                       trigonometry. Their names and abbreviations are sine (sin), cosine (cos), tangent (tan), cotangent (cot), secant (sec), and cosecant (csc).</p>
